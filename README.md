Whew! It's been a ride for sure, as my project completely changed. My wife asked me to make a Multiple Sclerosis symptom tracker for her, so I shelved the other project, and gave this my full focus (not to mention a couple sleepless nights, and this is lookin like one!) asap. It's nowhere near finished, but it is awful close to minimun viable product, and will have to do for now. Much more work ahead for the true, finished version. Come back some time and check it out when it's all shiny!

My calendar project extensively uses arrays in vanilla js, css, and html, that dynamically generates itself (out of buttons!!) based off the last day of the month, and auto aligns itself with the proper beginning day of week on 1st of month. Upon clicking, they take you to the secondary page, with checkboxes for commonly occurring symptoms (will be customizable in future, alas the Tempus Fugits) and an option to leave a more in depth note to be stored to local storage.

I am using the 3rd party api Google Fonts for the nice, clearly legible viewability on cell screens, where it will be used the most, and some icons, to jazz it up a bit. I will be implementing major customization in the future.

As far as I know, you shouldn't have any problems running it. Put everything in the same folder.
*Spoiler, it WAS a sleepless night!*
